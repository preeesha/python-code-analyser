CodeGraph AI ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

CodeGraph AI is an intelligent system that transforms Python source code into an interactive graph, capturing relationships between classes, 
functions, and variables. It leverages a multi-step agentic workflow using LangGraph, where specialized agents handle parsing, graph construction,
natural language query interpretation, Cypher generation, and visualization. Users can ask questions in plain English, and the system returns a 
dynamic decision-flow graph with insightful annotations, making complex codebases easy to explore and understand.
